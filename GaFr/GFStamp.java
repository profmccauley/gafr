/** An image which can be drawn to the screen.
  *
  * A texture is actually memory set aside for pixel data in your graphics
  * hardware.  But the question is... how and where do you want to draw it?
  * That's what this class is about.  It refers to a texture, but actually
  * lets you specify rotations, positions, and so on -- and then lets you
  * actually draw it.
  *
  * The stamp has a "pin" in it.  That is, if the image were on a little
  * piece of paper, the pin is where it's tacked onto the screen.  When
  * you position the image, it's relative to this pin.  When you rotate it,
  * it rotates around the pin.
  *
  * While the colors you see are mostly from the texture, you can specify
  * a color on the stamp; each channel (red, green, blue, and alpha) of
  * the given color are multiplied against the texture color.  This lets
  * you tint images to a degree.  Perhaps more interestingly, you can
  * set the alpha channel to made the image partially transparent.
