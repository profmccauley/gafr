/** A class for drawing image-based fonts.
  *
  * This class can draw image-based fonts to the screen.  These fonts can
  * be constructed "by hand" in code, or by loading one from a file.  GaFr
  * has support for the following image-based font formats:
  * * GaFr fixed fonts (.ffont.json).  These are simple fixed-width fonts.
  * * BMFont fonts.  These are supported by a variety of software.
  *
  * If your intest is primarily in creating GFFonts through code, you
  * might want to start your journey at the GFFont(GFStamp[], String)
  * constructor.  Otherwise, you may be interested in the GFFont(String)
  * constructor for loading from files.
  *
  * Getting Your Desired Fonts Into GaFr
  * ====================================
  * Today, most "normal" computer fonts are stored in the form of
  * mathematical formulas.  Font types like TrueType (.ttf), OpenType
  * (.otf), and PostScript fonts (.pfb, etc.) are all examples of this.
  * These are sometimes referred to as vector fonts or outline fonts,
  * and are generally not great for games.  In games, we usually want
  * to draw *images*.  We want the fonts in terms of bitmaps, the same
  * as sprites and stuff.  For this reason, we often don't use normal
  * font files directly.  Instead, it's common to convert from a normal
  * font file to an image-based font file.  In many cases, such a file
  * is actually two files: one is an image, which contains all the
  * characters of the font (sort of like a sprite sheet), and the other
  * is metadata saying where all the individual characters are on the
  * image, maybe how much space to put between characters; that sort
  * of thing.
  *
  * GaFr currently supports two such file formats.  One is a simple
  * home-grown file format, which currently only supports fixed-width
  * fonts (where each character is the same width).  This is the GaFr
  * Fixed Font format (stored in .ffont.json) files.  The other is
  * the BMFont format, which comes from the AngelCode Bitmap Font
  * Generator program.  See the relevant section below for more.
  *
  * GaFr Fixed Fonts
  * ================
  * GaFr has its own font file support.  Currently, these only support
  * fixed-width fonts.  The files come as a pair.  One contains meta-
  * data about the font (e.g., myfont.ffont.json).  The other is an
  * image with the actual font glyphs in it (e.g., myfont.ffont.png).
  *
  * Presently, these fonts can be easily generated from .psf font file
  * used by, e.g., Linux machines.  GaFr comes with a psf_to_ffont.py
  * utility to do the conversion.  For example:
  *
  *     python3 psf_to_png.py --out-dir=. /usr/share/consolefonts/Lat2-TerminusBold20x10.psf.gz
  *
  * BMFont Fonts
  * ============
  * BMFont comes from the AngelCode Bitmap Font Generator program.
  * Unsurprisingly, this program can generate BMFonts from a normal
  * TrueType font like many OSes use.  There are other similar tools
  * too.  For example, the libGDX community has a class and a simple
  * command-line tool for generating such fonts, as well as the more
  * fully-featured Hiero tool.
  *
  * A downside of the above tools is that they require you to install
  * software.  The SnowB Bitmap Font tool does more or less the same
  * stuff and runs in a web browser.  It has a lot of options for
  * selecting how large the output images should be (it will use more
  * than one if all the characters don't fit on one), lets you add
  * shadows/outlines, etc.  I've found it generates slightly nicer
  * images in Firefox than Chrome.  When you've got your font how
  * you want it, export it in the "BMFont TEXT" format with the ".fnt"
  * extension.  This will give you a zip file; unzip it and put the
  * files in your project somewhere.  You can then load it with the
  * single-string-parameter GFFont constructor.  See below for a link
  * to the SnowB tool.
  *

  * ===========
  * For further info, check the constructors:

  * PSF font info/links
  * -------------------
  * * [Screenshots](https://adeverteuil.github.io/linux-console-fonts-screenshots/)
  *   of a number of different PSF fonts.
  * * [PSF Tools](https://www.seasip.info/Unix/PSF/) is a set of tools
  *   for converting a number of fixed-width font formats into PSF...
  *   which you can then turn into GaFr fixed width fonts.
  * * [Wikipedia's PC Screen Font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Screen_Font)
  *   page has information about the PSF font format.
  * * [OSDev's PC Screen Font](https://wiki.osdev.org/PC_Screen_Font) page
  *   has more detailed information about the format.
  *
  *
  * BMFont info/links
  * -----------------
  * * The [AngelCode BMFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont)
  *   tool is the origin of the BMFont format that GaFr supports.  As
  *   well as having the tool, their site has details of the BMFont
  *   format (which were used to write GaFr's support).
  * * The libGDX website has information and tools for working with bitmap
  *   fonts on their [Hiero](https://libgdx.com/wiki/tools/hiero) page.
  * * The [SnowB Bitmap Font tool](https://snowb.org/) is a pretty nice
  *   web-based tool for generating BMFonts from normal outline fonts.

  /** Maximum character value for direct-mapping glyphs.
    *
    * Internally, glyphs might be stored in two different ways: direct-mapped
    * and hash-mapped.  When in direct-mapped mode, a character value is
    * simply an index into glyphMap which is an array.  This allows very
    * cheap, constant-time lookup to find glyph data for a character.
    *
    * The direct-mapped approach works great when the data is dense.  That
    * is, when almost every character code is used.  This is the case if
    * you are only interested in ASCII characters, for example.  All the
    * character codes are in the range of like 0 through 127.  However,
    * when working with Unicode characters, you may have some very large
    * character codes, and there may be huge gaps of unused codes between
    * the used ones; this is potentially very wasteful in terms of memory.
    *
    * Thus, we have the hash-mapped approach, which maps from character
    * code to glyph data via a hashmap.  This is more expensive in terms
    * of runtime, but potentially much more space efficient.
    *
    * MAX_DIRECT determines which mode we end up using.  We default to
    * using direct mapping, but if we ever see a character code larger
    * than MAX_DIRECT, we switch to the hashed mode.

  /** Constructs the font from a set of glyph stamps.

    * Especially in the old "demo scene", lots of people made lots of
    * image-based fonts.  You can find a lot of them on the web, e.g.,:
    * https://github.com/ianhan/BitmapFonts
    *
    * While we could create .ffont.json files for these, you can often
    * get away without it, especially for fixed-width fonts, which
    * many of them are.  A basic recipe is:
    * 1. Load the image into a GFTexture
    * 2. Use tex.splitIntoTilesBySize() to split the texture into
    *    a stamp for each character.  For example, if each character
    *    glyph was 20 by 30 pixels, you'd pass in 20,30.
    * 3. Construct a GFFont, passing in the stamps and a string which
    *    telling the GFFont which character corresponds to each glyph
    *    in reading order (left to right, top to bottom).
    *
    * For example, bb_font.png (available at the link above), can be
    * loaded as so:
    *
    *     GFTexture tex = new GFTexture("fonts/bb_font.png", 0xff000000, 0);
    *     GFStamp[] stamps = tex.splitIntoTilesBySize(32,26);

    *        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ! _;0123456789\"(),-.'?:" );
    *     font.collapseCase();
    *
    * Note that we make use of the texture constructor's color remapping
    * feature to make black transparent.  Additionally, we make use of
    * GFFont's collapseCase() feature so that we can print strings
    * containing both upper and lower case characters even though the
