This is a project built using the GaFr game framework.

To play it from this archive, you must have Python installed.

On Windows, you may just be able to double-click the "run_game" or
"run_game.py" file.  If that doesn't work, use the search feature to find
and run Windows PowerShell.  You'll be given a prompt.  Type "python3"
followed by a space.  Then drag and drop the "run_game" file from this
folder onto the PowerShell window.  It should fill in the complete filename.
Then simply press Enter.

On macOS, use Spotlight to open Terminal.  Type "python3" followed by a
space.  Drag and drop the "run_game.py" file from this folder onto the
Terminal window.  It should fill in the complete filename.  Then simply
press Return.
